# eslint-config-mysoft

## Install

```bash
npm install eslint-config-mysoft -D
```

## Usage

Shareable configs are designed to work with the `extends` feature of `.eslintrc` files.

*Note: We omitted the `eslint-config-` prefix since it is automatically assumed by ESLint.*

You can override settings from the shareable config by adding them directly into your
`.eslintrc` file.
